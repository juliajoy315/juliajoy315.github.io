    "- ***Theory***: *mathematical descriptions of frameworks and algorithms.*\n",

    "I expressed an interest in focusing a bit extra on the implementation category. I always feel like more practice with effective coding and learning how to use new tools is so invaluable, and I believe I have definitely successfully focused in on this category throughout both my blog post work as well as my final project work. My perceptron and linear regression blog posts honed in on the implementation category as I effectively implemented machine learning algorithms/models. Through my final project, I \n",
    " performed various implementation of machine learning models, such as decision trees and random forests, the models were implemented with and trained on synthetic medical data, to perform our final projects goals of predicting health risks by outputting model-calculated risk scores. Embracing these assignments as learning opportunities, I believe I successfully refined my skills and proficiency in the realm of Implementation of machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    " In my midcourse evals, I said that \"Our third week in the semester too maybe me more interested in the social responsibility side of machine learning algorithms, so potentially it would be interesting to conduct a series of experiments related to assessing algorithmic bias in a certain class of algorithm for my final project? We shall see!\" Looking back, I would say that I definitely focused in on the social responsibility category as well! I chose blog posts and projects that interested me throughout, so it is pleasant to see that I do find myself having a consistent pattern of interest in the social responsibility category. I completed the replication study and the WiDS conference blog posts both pertaining to the social responsibility category. Through my final project, I communicating our results in the context of identifying potential biases across different groups such as factors based on race, ethnicity, birthplace, and current town of residence, which required me to learn how to identify, understand, and evaluate environmental and societal inequities that may be influencing real-world health outcomes. \n",
    "\n",
    " I feel happy and proud of my work as it pertains to focusing in on any categories. I successfully focused in on Implementation, the category I set a goal out to do, and I discovered a newfound interest in the category of Social Responsibility as I noticed a recurring theme in the interest of my work. \n"

    "Overall, I acted in accordance with the course presence/participation goals I set. I believe I only missed two classes this semester, which completes my goal to attend nearly every class unless truly having to miss it. In my goal setting I had aimed to attempt every warmup before class and I can happily and proudly say that I have done so for every class period I attended. I have also stuck in line of my goals of doing most of the course readings as well as thoroughly participating in our small warmup groups. As before in my mid-semester reflection, I was right in my guessing that I would not be the biggest slack user, but I have asked all the questions I needed answered in some form or another, whether it be study group or an office hour drop in. I did struggle, as I expected, to raise my hand to answer questions in class, my shyness outweighing everything else. It is something I have tried to work on for a long time, so I had a continued awareness for it, but not much improvement in that regard. I believe I met all of the goals I set for presence and participation in this course. "

    "In my original goal setting, I said that I was \"excited about this project as I feel like it will allow me to explore what machine learning can be in an area that I'm a bit more interested in, whatever that may be\", and that \"I would like to complete all project milestones on time to keep myself and the group accountable in our semester time frame, contribute to the project in an equal manner including in the algorithm implementation and project presentation, and do what I can to be a great group project partner\". At the time I did not have an idea of what I exactly would want to work on in my final project, but during the mid-course reflections I mentioned that I would be interested in studying a data set and/or experimenting with assessing algorithmic bias. Through the project pitches, I found a project that greatly interested me: Implementing various machine learning models to generate risk scores and interpret its results in order to identify potential real-world inequities reflected by model generated risk scores. I worked with Lindsey and Sophie, and I found us to be a very well-oiled, effective and collaborative team. We did indeed complete all project milestones on time, keeping ourselves accountable in our semester time frame. We worked on the project bit by bit, piece by piece, and I was impressed myself with how well we timed the completion of our project. We all contributed to the project in an equal manner including in the algorithm implementation and project presentation, which was reflected in our group contribution statements on the project blog post. I was happy with my work in data visualization, model implementation, model experimentation, result analysis, project cleanup, and presentation. I think our project was successful both in its content and in our work as a team, more than meeting my expectations and goals for our project. \n",
