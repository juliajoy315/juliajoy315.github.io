    "\n",
    "- *How often have you attended class? I have attended every class except for 1. \n",
    "- *How often have you taken notes on the core readings ahead of the class period?* I always read the readings, but I probably take notes on them maybe 1/2-1/3 of the time? \n",
    "- *How often have you been **prepared** to present the daily warm-up exercise to your team, even if you weren't actually called?* Almost always, probably with the exception of 1 or 2 times. \n",
    "- *How many times have you **actually** presented the daily warm-up to your team?* I cant quite remember, maybe 3 or 4? \n",
    "- *How many times have you asked your team for help while presenting the daily warm-up?* I think for 1 part of a problem once. \n",
    "- *How often have you learned something new from a teammate's presentation of the daily warm-up?* I feel like I can frequently learn a little something new, even if I did the warmup correctly it is always informational to see other approaches or when we were having more discussion-based warmups I learned other perspectives to see things. \n",
    "- *How often have you helped a teammate during the daily warm-up presentation?* Once or twice but we always contribute to each other. \n",

    "\n",
    "- *How often have you attended Student Hours or Peer Help?* I have not attended Student Hours. \n",
    "- *How often have you asked for or received help from your fellow students?* I have a lot of friends in the class so we often meet together in a study group, so I probably ask someone a question around once a week whether its about the warmups, blog posts, or general clarification of things were supposed to be doing. \n",
    "- *Have you been regularly participating in a study group outside class?* Yes.\n",
    "- *How often have you posted questions or answers in Slack?* I have maybe posted one question. \n",

    "\n",
    "- *How many blog posts have you submitted?* I have submitted 3 blog posts and am currently working on 2 more. \n",

    "In the beginning, I expressed an interest in the Implementation category, as well as a tentative on in the theory category. I think I have definitely focused in on the Implementation category. I always feel like more practice with effective coding and learning how to use new tools is so invaluable, I feel like I have been able to continue that in this course with the learning of all of our new models like the Perceptron. In general too expanding my coding skills by getting more familiar with python and different packages like torch. I am excited to continue with more different kinds of Machine Learning algorithms and models! \n",
    "However for the theory category, I do not think I really would like to focus in on the category as much as I originally thought. I forgot how long it had been since I took linear algebra my freshman year, and I have never taken multi-variable calculus. I can obviously handle differentiation, and my mathematical knowledge/general understanding is definitely not lacking, but I realized that I have less interest in intense mathematical descriptions of frameworks and algorithms, I enjoy my little problem sets more. Thus I do not think I will be choosing to focus in on the Theory category that much anymore. I will focus more into the Implementation category as I have been. Our third(?) week in the semester too maybe me more interested in the social responsibility side of machine learning algorithms, so potentially it would be interesting to conduct a series of experiments related to assessing algorithmic bias in a certain class of algorithm for my final project? We shall see! "

    "In my original goal setting, I aimed to have a “Satisfactory/No Revision Required” rating on 5-6 of my of my blog posts, and perhaps completing more (I want to complete at least around 60-80% of blog posts) but leaving some space for some blog posts to remain in the “needs revision category”.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "I hadn't looked closely enough at the way blog posts were graded yet I guess, because now I know there are two categories that could satisfy that first part of my blog post goals: E: *No revisions suggested: and M: *Revisions useful:*. Ideally all would be E's, but I think I will leave the space for 1-2 blog posts to remain in the M category, as I have recieved enough feedback at this point to understand the difference between an E and M blog post, and that stays in accordance with my goals. Additionally in the second part of my goals for blog posts I said I want to complete around 60-80% of blog posts. After getting through half of the semester, I can understand now that completing 80% of the blog posts is simply out of reach for me in this class, especially as we approach our final projects starting. I also did not realize until after my goal setting that some weeks there would be 2 blog posts that could be completed, so that puts it more in perspective as well as I would only choose 1 of 2 options to complete and not both. I think my goal of completing roughly 60% of blog posts is good, as it is also in accordance with the number of 5-6 solid good work blog posts. \n",
    "\n",
    "Currently I have completed 3 blog posts (E,M,M), and have 2 more underway. There have been a total of 7 blog posts out that we could complete, so I am also doing well in my aim of a 60% completion ratio. \n",
    "\n",
    "I think that in my goals for the blog posts, I am generally on track to meet my goals from the beginning of the course! I will say that in my goal setting I did mention that ideally it would take me 1-1.5 weeks to complete a blog post and I have struggled to keep up with that timeline, due to other classwork and the fact that I find myself spending considerable amounts of time to thoroughly understand the warmups. I am trying to get better at this timeline, and I think after this week and my 2 in progress blog posts, I will be able to stick to the timeline better. I do think I place more importance in the actual progress of the blog posts rather than the speed at which I turn them in, so I think all should be well for my blog post goals!"

In my goal setting I had aimed to complete every warmup before class and I can happily and proudly say that I have done so for every class period in the semester so far! So my leeway of one or two missed warmups is still very much intact as well. I have also stuck in line of my goals of doing most of the course readings as well as thoroughly participating in our small warmup groups. I have yet to attend peer hours, but I have attended office hours a few times when the need struck which is what I expected and set as an outline for myself. I was right in my guessing that I would not be the biggest slack user, but I have asked all the questions I needed answered in some form or another which is good. Study groups have been big for me this semester too, since I know a good amount of people in the course and find it helpful to talk out some problems I run into, or to confirm things we discuss in class. \n",

I have the same goals as before, \"I would like to complete all project milestones roughly on time to keep myself and the group accountable in our semester time frame, contribute to the project in an equal manner including in the algorithm implementation and project presentation, and do what I can to be a great group project partner.\", and I do think I will be able to stick in accordance with those goals as our project approaches. This weekend I need to brainstorm what I would like to do for our final project. I think that studying  a complex data set in depth, or conducting a series of experiments related to assessing algorithmic bias in a certain class of algorithm interests me more than implementing a new algorithm. However I will also draw inspiration from other peoples project pitches and who knows maybe I will discover something new and interesting to focus in on for our final project. "
