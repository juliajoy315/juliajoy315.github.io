    "\n",
    "# Why is it a problem that women are underrepresented in computing, math, and engineering? For whom is it a problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Gender biases can create obstacles not only for\n",
    "women in technical workplaces but also for the\n",
    "men who work with them. In one study of equally\n",
    "performing teams working on a male-typed task,\n",
    "teams with a higher percentage of women rated\n",
    "both their female and male peers’ work more negatively overall and expressed less desire to work\n",
    "together in the future (West et al., 2012). Another\n",
    "study found that in a typically male field, people\n",
    "rated their male colleagues as less masculine and\n",
    "less deserving of workplace success if they had\n",
    "female supervisors (Brescoll, Uhlmann et al., 2012).\n",
    "This research sheds light on the magnitude of the\n",
    "problem of gender bias in predominantly male fields\n",
    "and perhaps points to one mechanism by which it\n",
    "is maintained. If men’s work is devalued when men\n",
    "work with women, men might take steps to avoid\n",
    "working with women, exacerbating the challenges\n",
    "facing women in male-dominated fields. While\n",
    "diversity has demonstrated benefits, there are real\n",
    "challenges to achieving it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Diversity in\n",
    "the workforce contributes to creativity, productivity, and innovation. Women’s experiences—along\n",
    "with men’s experiences—should inform and guide\n",
    "the direction of engineering and technical innovation\n",
    "The United States simply can’t afford to ignore\n",
    "the perspectives of half the population in future\n",
    "engineering and technical designs.\n",
    "lose out on these high-quality\n",
    "job opportunities that account for more than 80% of stem workforce\n",
    "more likely to choose a male candidate over\n",
    "an identical female candidate for a hypothetical job\n",
    "opening at a lab. Both female and male scientists also offered a higher salary to the male candidate.\n",
    "Gender biases affect not only how we view and\n",
    "treat others but also how we view ourselves and\n",

    "# Which of the barriers and unequal challenges described in the section “Why So Few?” can be eroded by events that spotlight the achievement of women in STEM?\n",
    "\n",
    "The section \"Why so Few?\" outlines various barriers and unequal challenges women face in the STEM field, such as sense of belonging, stereotypes and stereotype threat, challenging academic workspaces, as well as isolation. Women may face negative impacts such as experiencing difficultly balancing expected gendered home responsibilities and the culture of overwork, feel deincentivized by the engineering culture of disengagement as studies show women are more likely than men to express a preference for work with a clear social purpose (Konrad et al., 2000), or feel isolated as significant portion of women reported feeling as if they lacked role models and mentors and did not agree with the statement that \"it is safe to speak up most of the time\". While not all of these barriers or challenges can be eroded by events that spotlight the achievement of women in STEM, there are a few that can benefit from these events. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What stood out most notably to me that could be benefited by these events was improving the sense of belonging for women in STEM.\n",
    "Events that spotlight the achievement of women in STEM shows examples of women in a historically male-dominated field, helping combat both internalized and external stereotypes. These events show women that success in STEM is possible, providing role models and mentors, increasing womens sense of belonging and thus hopefully increasing the number of women in STEM. \n",

    "Many women report lacking role models and role models (about half reported lacking mentors in a study done by Hewlett et al., 2008).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the STEM field, women face gender stereotypes..., that all contribute to a lower sense of belonging than men in the same field. \n",
